			     PC BOOTER
			     =========

---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.
   Alex Ryan - 22 hours
   Jaden Geller - 26 hours

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.
   Alex Ryan - Bootloader, keyboard, basic drawing functions,
               visual design of board + pieces, high score
   Jaden Geller - Interrupts, game logic (shifting, merging, game over, etc),
		game animation, game colors + color changing pieces

Note that this design document is a bit long.  Most of the questions can be
answered pretty briefly.  Don't feel a need to write a long answer if it is
not required by the question.

			     GAME / DEMO
			     ===========

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A1: In 25-30 words or less, what does your PC booter do?
	The PC bootloader uses BIOS functions to load a C program off of a disk
	into memory, switches into protected mode, and executes the C program. The C
	program is a recreation of the popular online puzzle game, 2048.

>> A2: In 25-30 words or less, how does the user interact with the program?
>> What are the controls?  What should the user try to do?
	The user uses the arrow keys to move numbered blocks on a 4x4 board.
	Blocks that have the same number collapse into a single block (with
	double that number) when they are moved onto each other. With each move,
	a new block appears on the board at a random position. When there are no
	more moves available, the game ends. The objective is to get as high
	of a score as possible - that is, to create a block with as high a number
	as possible. The only other control is pressing the Enter key to start
	a new game.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A3: Describe any global state that your program manages in order to
>> perform its operations.  Don't focus on state managed within interrupt
>> handlers; we will look at that later.  Rather, focus on state that is
>> part of the game implementation itself.

The game doesn't involve any global state. All data structures used by
the game are declared on the stack before the game loop. The game has a
board (a 2D integer array) and an animation helper (keeps track of how much
pieces moved and in what direction). 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: From the perspective of the entire program, briefly describe how
>> the various interrupts are handled and processed within your program.
>> For example, when a timer interrupt occurs, what is the general sequence
>> of operations or updates that is performed within your program?
>> Similarly, when a keyboard interrupt occurs, what does your program do
>> in response?
	When a timer interrupt occurs, we increment a counter variable.
	When a keyboard interrupt occurs, our program checks if the scancode
	represents one of the five keys our game uses. If it does, it stores it
	in a circular queue of key events.

>> A5: Would you say your program relies on polling or busy-waiting anywhere
>> to accomplish its tasks?  If so, what tasks?
	Our sleep() function is implemented as a busy-wait, and our main game
	loop is a busy-wait when there are no key events to dequeue.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose the project you did?

The algorithm for shifting the board seemed like an interesting challenge to
program. The game was easily representable on the display, the game
was easily playable via the keyboard, and the animations required use of the timer.
Also it's a really fun game.

>> A7: Did your choice of project affect any of the specific implementation
>> details of the various subsystems that you needed to use?  (For example,
>> if you implemented a scrolling game, did you implement specialized high-
>> performance video code to scroll the screen?)

No.

>> A8: Did you run into any technical or resource limitations in the
>> implementation of your program?  (For example, bootloader didn't fit,
>> or a really useful standard library wasn't available, or you couldn't
>> achieve the desired performance level, etc.)  If so, what steps did you
>> take to try to overcome those limitations?
	Several common standard libraries would have been very helpful to have.
	We experimented with statically linking them into our executable but ended
	up working around using them instead.
	Access to the Intel RDRAND instruction would have been convenient, but we
	used RDTSC to seed a random number generator instead.

			     BOOT SECTOR
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: How did you decide to store the Disk Address Packet?  Does the
>> memory occupied by the DAP get reclaimed after it is used?  If not,
>> why not?
	The DAP is constructed by pushing the relevant doublewords onto the stack.
	After being used, it's popped off the stack.

>> B2: Does your bootloader pass any information to the main program?
>> (If not, just say no.)  If so, what information is passed, and how
>> is it passed?
	No. We considered using int $0x1a to get the current time, but used the
	RDTSC instruction in inline assembly in our C code instead.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Briefly describe how your bootloader brings your program into
>> memory.  Does it perform one large load, or multiple smaller loads?
	The bootloader uses a single BIOS interrupt call to load the program into
	memory.

>> B4: Did you add any BIOS calls to your bootloader to prepare for your
>> main program?  (i.e. things that aren't available in protected mode)
	No.

			  VIDEO SUBSYSTEM
			  ===============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: What video display mode does your program use?  Is it a text mode
>> or a graphical mode?  Where does the video buffer start?  How is data
>> represented in this mode?  (Please be brief; we don't need complete
>> documentation on the video system.)
	Our program uses text mode. The video buffer starts at 0xB8000.
	Each of the 80x25 character "pixels" is represented by two bytes, containing
	the foreground color, the background color, and the letter to print.

>> C2: Does your video code maintain any variables or data structures to
>> facilitate video output?  Briefly describe these values and their
>> purposes here.
	The game loop has a animation tracking struct that is used to compute
	the position of pieces for a given frame. This struct is populated
	a time of shift, and it is used in a functional way to determine
	the piece positions as a function of time.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C3: What abstraction does your video code present to your main program?
>> Briefly describe the higher-level operations you decided to implement.
	We implemented operations that, given a board, will draw it to the board.
	These were implemented in terms of lower level primitives such as
	`draw_string` that we also wrote. We later wrote an animated draw board
	function that, given a tilmestep, will draw the correct piece position
	for the slide.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Did you take any specific steps to improve the appearance of your
>> program's display output?  For example, using Extended ASCII Codes, or
>> choosing specific colors to represent different things?
	We used a gray background with vibrant piece colors to draw attention to
	the board and to make it easy to identify the possible moves. The pieces
	and the board make use of extended ASCII codes to display borders.

			  TIMER SUBSYSTEM
			  ===============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> D1: What state does your timer subsystem manage?  Describe the variables
>> or data structures that it maintains, and how they are used.
	The timer subsystem manages a single state variable, a counter that is
	incremented every time a timer interrupt is received. This allows us
	to keep a rough estimate of the amount of time elapsed since the program
	started, which we use to implement a sleep function.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> D2: What abstraction does your timer code present to your main program?
>> Briefly describe the higher-level operations you decided to implement.

>> D3: Did you change the timer frequency from 100Hz?  If so, what did you
>> change it to, and why?
	At first we changed the timer frequency to 1000Hz so that we could
	easily allow the argument of our sleep() function to be milliseconds,
	but actually found that the VM was too slow to keep up with the timer
	interrupts, resulting in 1000 interrupts being processed about every
	2.5 seconds. We then changed it back to 100Hz and had no problems.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> D4: Given how your program handles timer events, is there any potential
>> for timer interrupts to generate race conditions in updating your
>> program's global state?  If so, what steps did you take to ensure that
>> such situations cannot occur?
	No - the only critical code is in the keyboard queue update functions,
	and interrupts are disabled there.

			KEYBOARD SUBSYSTEM
			==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> E1: What state does your keyboard subsystem manage?  Describe the variables
>> or data structures that it maintains, and how they are used.
	The keyboard subsystem manages a variable called `modified` which is set when
	a 0xE0 scancode is received (the first part of a multi-part scan code). It is
	unset when the next scancode is received. It also manages a circular queue of
	recognized key events.

>> E2: How do your data structures handle keys with multi-byte scan-codes?
	If 0xE0 is received, the `modified` variable is set. Then the next time a
	scancode is received, it is run through a different switch statement of
	all the scancodes that come after a 0xE0, and the `modified` variable is unset.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> E3: What abstraction does your keyboard code present to your main program?
>> Briefly describe the higher-level operations you decided to implement.
	Our keyboard code is very well encapsulated, only exposing a isemptyqueue()
	and a dequeue() function to the main program (enqueuing should only happen
	within the keyboard interrupt handler).

>> E4: Does your keyboard subsystem expose scan-codes directly to your main
>> program, or does it preprocess them and expose other information to your
>> main program?  If scan-code data is preprocessed, briefly describe what
>> information is actually exposed, and how it is derived from scan-codes.
	Scancode data is preprocessed. When a scancode is received, we check if it's
	associated with one of the five keys we're interested in and if so, we add
	it (as an enum value, not the original scancode) to the circular queue.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> E5: Given how your keyboard interrupt handler operates, is there any
>> potential for race conditions in updating the keyboard subsystem's
>> internal state?  If so, what steps did you take to ensure that such
>> situations cannot occur?
	Yes - an interrupt could occur during the dequeue() function. To ensure this
	doesn't happen, we disable the interrupt flag before running that code (and
	restore it when we're done, if it was enabled before.) The enqueue() function
	is only used within an interrupt handler, so it shouldn't be interrupted;
	nonetheless, we saved and restored the interrupt flag there too in case any
	future programmer decides to call it elsewhere.

>> E6: Given how your program handles keyboard events, is there any
>> potential for keyboard interrupts to generate race conditions in updating
>> your program's global state?  If so, what steps did you take to ensure
>> that such situations cannot occur?
	No - the only critical code in the program is in the keyboard queue
	update functions.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> E7: Why did you choose the design and data representation that your
>> keyboard subsystem uses?  How is it suited to your program's overall
>> operation?
	Interpreting keyboard events as they happen (rather than dumping the
	raw scancodes into a queue to be interpreted elsewhere) certainly made
	our program much cleaner. Since we are only working with a few keys,
	having them represented by an enum was very convenient.

			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any of the parts of it, too
>> easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?
	It wasn't too hard but it certainly took far too much time. Though it was
	interesting to write a video game, it was very time consuming compared to
	how much OS-specific knowledge was learned. It was fun though.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?
	The bootloader part of the assignment was very interesting and totally
	new material to me, insight into an important part of computers that
	I otherwise probably would never have encountered.

>> Were there any parts of the assignment that you felt were unnecessarily
>> tedious or pointless?
	The entire assignment past the bootloader felt essentially useless to me,
	and it consumed the majority of the time. Getting keyboard and timer
	interrupts working was educational, but could have been just as easily
	accomplished by printing keyboard input to the screen and flashing the
	color. The majority of the time on this assignment was spent programming
	a simple game in a very restricted subset of C, which isn't useful to me at all.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the instructor and/or TAs to more
>> effectively assist students, either for future quarters or the remaining
>> projects?

>> Any other comments?
