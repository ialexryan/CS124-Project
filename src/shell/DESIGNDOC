			   COMMAND SHELL
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.
   
   Alex Ryan spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment.
   Jaden Geller spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment.

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.
   
   Alex Ryan implemented:
   - Core use of readline framework
   - Prompt
   - Internal commands
   - Executing external commands and forking/waiting
   - Pipes

   Jaden Geller implemented:
   - Parsing
   - File redirection
   - File appending
   - stdin/out/err redirection
   - Readline history feature

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Describe how your command shell manages parsing and executing
>> commands that contain arguments and pipes, using the example
>> command "a arg1 arg2 | b arg1 | c arg1 arg2 arg3".  How does your
>> shell internally represent such a command?

Commands are parsed using a simplistic state machine. Essentially, 
we loop over each character of the input and, based on both the
character and the current state, we determine what to do. We don't
actually allocate new memory and copy the arguments into it. We simply
null-out separator characters between arguments, and use these remaining
strings in-place. In the specific example case, the resulting memory 
block will look as follows after parsing, where * represents NULL:

"a*arg1*arg2***b*arg1***c*arg1*arg2*arg3"

We represent each command (the things separated by pipes) using a 
`command` data structure. This stores a pointer to a list of
arguments and information about the necessary file redirection.
This list of arguments is stored on a stack-allocated array.
Essentially, as we build commands, we add arguments to the array.
When we reach a pipe (and thus finish an `argv` list), we place
a NULL in the array and continue. This way, we can use the same
shared buffer space for all argument lists.

When we encounter the first character of a token (anything that
isn't a specially handled other character), we place a pointer to
it (as it is the beginning of the string) in the `argv` list
before we even read the rest of it. No special actions are taken
after tokens are read; the important part is at the beginning.

>> A2: Now, given the command:
>> "a arg1 arg2 < inp.txt | b arg1 | c arg1 arg2 arg3 > out.txt"
>> Briefly explain specifically how the redirections are parsed and
>> represented, and by what processes.

When a pipe is encountered, we simply increment the variable representing
the current command we're parsing and setup the next command. When the
parse function returns, it returns the pointer after the last command
parsed so that the pipes can be later set up and the list of commands
can be executed.

When a chevron is encountered, a enum is changed to remember that
the next token we read is meant to be stored as a certain kind of
redirection instead of as a normal argument. Then, when we read the
first character of the token, we store the pointer to it not in the
argv list, but instead in the commands stdin/stdout/stderr replacement
property.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A3: Illustrate how you solved the problem of setting up
>> redirection in a simple command like "a < inp.txt > out.txt", by
>> describing what process takes care of the redirection and when.

>> A4: Illustrate how you solved the problem of setting up the pipes
>> between multiple operations in a single command, by describing
>> what each process is responsible for.  For example, given the
>> command "a | b | c", describe the sequence of steps in setting up
>> the processes and their pipes, starting with your command shell's
>> process, and going through the execution of programs a, b and c.
>> Keep your description of each process' responsibilities limited to
>> ~25 words or less.
   For cases where there are multiple commands, the shell process creates
   pipes (one fewer than the number of commands) and stores the necessary
   information about them in the appropriate command structs. Then when
   the commands are forked, the child process replaces its stdin/out file
   descriptors as necessary and then executes its command. The parent process
   is responsible for closing the pipe file descriptors.

>> A5: Similarly, describe the details of how terminated processes are
>> reaped in the example command "a | b | c".
   After the pipes are set up and the commands are executed, the shell
   wait()'s for child processes until there are no more child processes
   to reap.

>> A6: Similarly, describe which processes are responsible for setting
>> up the redirections in the example command
>> "a < inp.txt | b | c > out.txt".

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A7: Why must the chdir and exit commands be implemented as built-in
>> functions, rather than external programs?

   Chdir and exit are the only commands that modify the state of the shell itself.
   In the case of exit the shell program has to end itself, and in the case
   of chdir the shell process has to ask the OS to change its current working
   directory.

>> A8: Why did you ultimately choose this design?  In what ways is it
>> superior to other designs you considered as you developed your solution?

			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?
   Alex: It was about right on both difficulty and time.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?
   Alex: Absolutely - it was a good refresher on forking, and I haven't ever
         built an application directly with Unix API's before.

>> Were there any parts of the assignment that you felt were unnecessarily
>> tedious or pointless?
   Alex: Parsing - somehow ends up being a part of every project in every class
         despite not having anything to do with the subject material. Ends up
         being a waste of time because you just make a single-use state machine
         and once you've done that once, doing it over and over again in each class
         is really tedious.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?
   Alex: More information about how fork() and wait() work/interact would have
         been very useful. 

>> Do you have any suggestions for the instructor and/or TAs to more
>> effectively assist students, either for future quarters or the remaining
>> projects?

>> Any other comments?
