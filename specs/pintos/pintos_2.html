<H1> 2. Project 1: Command Shell </H1>
<!--docid::SEC15::-->
<P>

This assignment will give you a chance to warm up your C programming skills,
see what the UNIX operating system offers in terms of system calls, and also
let you implement one of the most important system applications:  a command
shell.  Your command shell must be able to run programs on Linux platforms,
and must support basic IO redirection and piping between commands.  (If you
want to take it further than that, there are many extra credit options you
can complete as well.)
</P>
<P>

Before you get started, you will need to set up your code repository
properly.  Please read <A HREF="pintos_13.html#SEC200">F.3 Version Control</A> for details on how to get
started.  You should also read <A HREF="pintos_13.html#SEC206">F.4 Virtual Machine</A> for information on
how to download and set up the 32-bit Linux virtual machine you can use
for your software development.
</P>
<P>

You will complete your command shell in the <Q><TT>src/shell</TT></Q> directory for
this assignment.  Note that this assignment doesn't require you to use any
code within Pintos; it is a completely stand-alone assignment.  (We won't
give you any Pintos code until we get to the Pintos assignments, so that it
isn't overwhelming to you.)

<H3> 2.1.1 Overview </H3>
<!--docid::SEC17::-->
<P>

Command shells are the most basic tools that facilitate user interaction
with the operating system, and one of the oldest.  Although modern operating
systems with graphical user interfaces no longer require users to work at
a command prompt, most OSes still provide a command shell for lower level
tasks.
</P>
<P>

There are a variety of UNIX command shells, each with its own strengths,
but virtually all of them use a very basic syntax for specifying commands.
For example:
</P>
<P>

<CODE>grep Allow logfile.txt</CODE>
</P>
<P>

The command is <CODE>&quot;grep&quot;</CODE>, and the two arguments are <CODE>&quot;Allow&quot;</CODE>
and <CODE>&quot;logfile.txt&quot;</CODE>.  The command shell runs the program
&quot;<CODE>grep</CODE>&quot; (wherever it might appear on the current filesystem
path), and passes it an array of 3 arguments:
</P>
<P>

<CODE>char *argv[] = { &quot;grep&quot;, &quot;Allow&quot;, &quot;logfile.txt&quot;, NULL };</CODE>
</P>
<P>

(The argument list is always terminated with a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.  In this
case, <CODE>argc = 3</CODE> even though there are four elements in <CODE>argv</CODE>.)
</P>
<P>

Note that the command is tokenized by whitespace (spaces and tabs).  If we
want an argument to preserve its whitespace, it must be enclosed in double
quotes, like this:
</P>
<P>

<CODE>grep &quot; Allowing access&quot; logfile.txt</CODE>
</P>
<P>

Now, the argument array is as follows:
</P>
<P>

<CODE>char *argv[] = { &quot;grep&quot;, &quot; Allowing access&quot;, &quot;logfile.txt&quot;, NULL };</CODE>
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="Built-In Commands"></A>
<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC18"></A>
<H3> 2.1.2 Built-In Commands </H3>
<!--docid::SEC18::-->
<P>

You may wonder how your shell will support commands like <CODE>ls</CODE>,
<CODE>rm</CODE> and <CODE>cat</CODE>, but the good news is that your computer
provides these commands and many more as programs in the <Q><TT>/bin</TT></Q> directory.
Thus, your shell will automatically support all of these commands once you can
fork a child process and execute a program.
</P>
<P>

However, not all commands can be implemented this way.  There are two
specific commands that must be supported as built-in commands:
</P>
<P>

<CODE>cd</CODE> or <CODE>chdir</CODE> - Changes the current working directory of
the shell.  If no argument is specified, the shell should change to the
user's home directory, otherwise the argument is the directory to change to.
</P>
<P>

<CODE>exit</CODE> - Causes the shell to terminate.
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="Input/Output Redirection"></A>
<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC19"></A>
<H3> 2.1.3 Input/Output Redirection </H3>
<!--docid::SEC19::-->
<P>

Most command shells also allow you to redirect standard input from a file
to a process, or redirect standard output from a process to a file.  For
example, we can type:
</P>
<P>

<CODE>grep Allow &lt; logfile.txt &gt; output.txt</CODE>
</P>
<P>

Now, instead of taking its standard input from the console, <CODE>grep</CODE>
will see the contents of <Q><TT>logfile.txt</TT></Q> on its standard input.  Similarly,
when <CODE>grep</CODE> prints out its results, they will automatically go into
the file <Q><TT>output.txt</TT></Q> instead of being displayed on the console.
</P>
<P>

Note that whitespace is not required around the &lt; and &gt; characters; for
example, this is a valid (albeit ugly) command:
</P>
<P>

<CODE>grep Allow&lt;logfile.txt&gt;output.txt</CODE>
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="Pipes"></A>
<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC20"></A>
<H3> 2.1.4 Pipes </H3>
<!--docid::SEC20::-->
<P>

Besides being able to redirect input and output to various locations, most
command shells also support piping the output of one process to the input of
another process.  For example, one might do the following:
</P>
<P>

<CODE>grep Allow &lt; logfile.txt | grep -v google | sort | uniq -c &gt; out.txt</CODE>
</P>
<P>

In this example, four processes are started:
</P>
<P>

<UL>

<LI>
The first process runs the <CODE>grep</CODE> program, and receives the
arguments <CODE>{&quot;grep&quot;, &quot;Allow&quot;, NULL}</CODE>.  Its standard input is the
contents of the file <Q><TT>logfile.txt</TT></Q>.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
The standard output from the first process is piped to the standard input of
the second process, which also runs the <CODE>grep</CODE> program.  The second
program receives the arguments <CODE>{&quot;grep&quot;, &quot;-v&quot;, &quot;google&quot;, NULL}</CODE>.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
The standard output from the second process is piped to the standard input
of the third process, which runs the <CODE>sort</CODE> utility.  It receives
the argument array <CODE>{&quot;sort&quot;, NULL}</CODE>, and that's it.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
The standard input from the third process is piped to the standard input of
the fourth process, which runs the <CODE>uniq</CODE> utility.  The <CODE>uniq</CODE>
program receives the arguments <CODE>{&quot;uniq&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, NULL}</CODE> and its
standard output is redirected into the output file &quot;<Q><TT>out.txt</TT></Q>&quot;.
<P>

</UL>
<P>

Note that such commands are processed from left to right.  As before, pipes
do not require whitespace around them, so you can also type the above as:
</P>
<P>

<CODE>grep Allow&lt;logfile.txt|grep -v google|sort|uniq -c&gt;out.txt</CODE>
</P>
<P>

The parsing is clearly not trivial, particularly in the context of
double-quoted strings.  If a pipe or redirection character appears within a
double-quoted string then it is ignored.  The shell must break the input
command-string into a sequence of tokens using whitespace, &quot;|&quot; pipe characters,
and the redirection characters &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot;, unless of course it sees a
double-quote in which case it will consume characters until it reaches the
closing double-quote.
</P>
<P>

Once the command-string is tokenized, individual commands can be identified by
searching for the &quot;|&quot; pipe tokens in the sequence, and then within each command
the redirection characters can be processed as necessary.
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="Project 1 Requirements"></A>
<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC21"></A>
<H2> 2.2 Requirements </H2>
<!--docid::SEC21::-->

To receive full credit, your submission for Project 1 must include all aspects
described in this section.
</P>

<A NAME="Project 1 Design Document"></A>
<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC22"></A>
<H3> 2.2.1 Design Document </H3>
<!--docid::SEC22::-->
<P>

Before you turn in your project, you must copy <A HREF="cmdshell.tmpl">the project 1 design document template</A> into your source tree under the
name <Q><TT>src/shell/DESIGNDOC</TT></Q> and fill it in.  We recommend that you
read the design document template before you start working on the project.
See section <A HREF="pintos_11.html#SEC181">D. Project Documentation</A>, for a sample design document that goes along
with a fictitious project.
</P>
<P>

(Note:  You don't have to put the commit-hash into the design document
that you check into the repository, since that will obviously depend on
the rest of the commit!  It only needs to be in the one you submit on the
course website.)
</P>

<A NAME="Shell Program"></A>
<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC23"></A>
<H3> 2.2.2 Shell Program </H3>
<!--docid::SEC23::-->
<P>

You should implement your shell in the C file <Q><TT>mysh.c</TT></Q> (for &quot;my
shell&quot;).  Feel free to add other header or source files if you prefer,
but your <CODE>main()</CODE> method is expected to be in this file.
</P>
<P>

It should be possible to build your shell program with the provided
<Q><TT>Makefile</TT></Q>.  If you add source files you will need to modify the
<Q><TT>Makefile</TT></Q>'s contents.
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="Shell Prompt"></A>
<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC24"></A>
<H3> 2.2.3 Shell Prompt </H3>
<!--docid::SEC24::-->
<P>

Your shell should present a prompt that contains the username and the entire
current working directory, in a form something like this:
</P>
<P>

<CODE>username:current/working/directory&gt;</CODE>
</P>
<P>

(A description of various helpful UNIX functions follows in the next section;
the current username and working directory are both available via function
calls.)
</P>
<P>

The command the user types should be on the same line as the prompt,
immediately following the prompt.
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="Shell Behavior"></A>
<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC25"></A>
<H3> 2.2.4 Shell Behavior </H3>
<!--docid::SEC25::-->
<P>

Your shell implementation should support all functionality described in
the <A HREF="pintos_2.html#SEC16">2.1 Background</A> section above, including the built-in
commands, forking and executing commands, input/output redirection, and
piped commands.  It should be able to parse commands of the format outlined
above as well, including double-quoted strings containing internal spaces,
and redirection/pipe symbols &lt;, &gt; and |,  both with and without spaces on
one or both sides of the symbols.
</P>
<P>

You should assume that all commands will be entered on a single line;
commands will never contain internal newline characters.  Also, you can
assume that commands will be &lt; 1KiB in length.
</P>
<P>

You can also assume that piping and redirection will not be used in bizarre
or meaningless ways, e.g. <CODE>someprog &gt; foo.txt | anotherprog</CODE>.
(In this example, standard output is redirected to <Q><TT>foo.txt</TT></Q> and then
it is piped to the next program; this doesn't make much sense.  Widely used
shells like Bash will parse and execute such commands, but you don't have to.)
Your shell only has to handle syntactically correct commands.
</P>
<P>

In your code, you should not use the literals 0/1/2 for the stdin/stdout/stderr
file descriptors; rather, use the constants <CODE>STDIN_FILENO</CODE>,
<CODE>STDOUT_FILENO</CODE>, and <CODE>STDERR_FILENO</CODE>.
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="Error Handling"></A>
<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC26"></A>
<H3> 2.2.5 Error Handling </H3>
<!--docid::SEC26::-->
<P>

Your shell should be resilient to all errors that can be reported by the
standard UNIX functions you use.  For example, a command might not be found,
a <CODE>fork()</CODE> operation might fail, a file receiving a program's output might
not be able to be created, etc.  Make sure you read the documentation for all
API calls you use, and gracefully handle and report any errors that occur.
</P>
<P>

Note that the C standard header file <Q><TT>errno.h</TT></Q> includes some very
helpful functions for reporting useful error messages based on the error
codes returned from the standard API calls.
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="Project 1 Useful UNIX Functions"></A>
<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC27"></A>
<H2> 2.3 Useful UNIX Functions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC27::-->
<P>

This section points out some of the standard functions that you might find
really useful for this assignment.  You are not required to use all of them;
some will be necessary to implement the specified functionality, but others
are simply only one option for the implementation.
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="The man Utility"></A>
<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC28"></A>
<H3> 2.3.1 The <CODE>man</CODE> Utility </H3>
<!--docid::SEC28::-->
<P>

You will need to use the UNIX file API and the UNIX process API for this
assignment.  However, there are too many functions for us to enumerate and
describe all of them.  Therefore you must become familiar with the
<CODE>man</CODE> utility, if you aren't already.  Running the command
<CODE>man</CODE> command will display information about that command (called
a &quot;man page&quot;), and specifically, <CODE>man unix_func</CODE> will display the
man page for the UNIX function <CODE>unix_func()</CODE>.  So, when you are looking
at the UNIX functions needed to implement this assignment, use <CODE>man</CODE>
to access detailed information about them.
</P>
<P>

The <CODE>man</CODE> program presents you with a simple page of text about the
command or function you are interested in, and you can navigate the text
using these commands:
</P>
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Down arrow goes forward one line
<LI>Up arrow goes back one line
<LI>&quot;f&quot; or Spacebar goes forward a page
<LI>&quot;b&quot; goes back a page
<LI>&quot;G&quot; goes to the end of the man page
<LI>&quot;g&quot; goes to the start of the man page
<LI>&quot;q&quot; exits <CODE>man</CODE>
</UL>
<P>

One problem with <CODE>man</CODE> is that there are often commands and functions
with the same name; the UNIX command &quot;<CODE>open</CODE>&quot; and the UNIX file API
function &quot;<CODE>open()</CODE>&quot; are an example of this.  To resolve situations like
this, <CODE>man</CODE> collects keywords into groups called &quot;sections&quot;; when
<CODE>man</CODE> is run, the section to use can also be specified as an argument
to <CODE>man</CODE>.  For example, all shell commands are in section &quot;1&quot;.  (You
can see this when you run <CODE>man</CODE>; for example, when you run
&quot;<CODE>man ls</CODE>&quot; you will see the text <TT>LS(1)</TT> at the top of the man page.)
Standard UNIX APIs are usually in section 2, and standard C APIs are usually
in section 3.
</P>
<P>

So, if you run &quot;<CODE>man open</CODE>&quot;, you will see the documentation for the
<CODE>open</CODE> command from section 1.  However, if you run
&quot;<CODE>man 2 open</CODE>&quot;, you will see the description of the <CODE>open()</CODE> API
call, along with what header file to include when you use it, and so forth.
</P>
<P>

You can often even look at some of the libraries of functions by using the
name of the header file.  For example, &quot;<CODE>man string</CODE>&quot; (or
&quot;<CODE>man 3 string</CODE>&quot;) will show you the functions available in
<Q><TT>string.h</TT></Q>, and &quot;<CODE>man stdio</CODE>&quot; will show you the functions
available in <Q><TT>stdio.h</TT></Q>.
</P>
<P>

<HR SIZE="6">
<A NAME="SEC29"></A>
<H3> 2.3.2 Console I/O Functions </H3>
<!--docid::SEC29::-->
<P>

You can use <CODE>printf()</CODE> and <CODE>scanf()</CODE> (declared in <Q><TT>stdio.h</TT></Q>) for
your input and output, although it is probably better to use <CODE>fgets()</CODE> to
receive the command from the user.  <STRONG>Do not use <CODE>gets()</CODE>, ever!!!</STRONG>
You should always use <CODE>fgets(stdio, ...)</CODE> instead of <CODE>gets()</CODE> since
it will allow you to specify the buffer length.  Using <CODE>gets()</CODE> virtually
guarantees that your program will contain buffer overflow exploits.

<H3> 2.3.3 String Manipulation Functions </H3>
<!--docid::SEC30::-->

The C standard API includes many string manipulation functions for you to
use in parsing commands.  These functions are declared in the header file
<Q><TT>string.h</TT></Q>.  You can either use these functions, or you can analyze
and process command strings directly.

The <Q><TT>unistd.h</TT></Q> header file includes standard process management
functions like forking a process and waiting for a process to terminate.
</P>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>getlogin()</CODE>

<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>fork()</CODE>
<DD>Forks the calling process into a parent and a child process.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>wait()</CODE>
<DD>Waits for a child process to terminate, and returns the status of the
terminated process.  Note that a process can only wait for its own children;
it cannot wait e.g. for grandchildren or for other processes.  This constrains
how command-shells must start child processes for piped commands.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>execve()</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>execvp()</CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>execve()</CODE> function loads and runs a new program into the
current process.  However, this function doesn't search the path for
the program, so you always have to specify the absolute path to the
program to be run.  However, there are a number of wrappers to the
<CODE>execve()</CODE> function.  One of these is <CODE>execlp()</CODE>, and it
examines the path to find the program to run, if the command doesn't
include an absolute path.
<P>

Be careful to read the man page on <CODE>execvp()</CODE> so that you satisfy
all requirements of the argument array.  (Note that once you have
prepared your argument array, your call will be something like
<CODE>execvp(argv[0], argv)</CODE>.)

<A NAME="SEC33"></A>
<H2> 2.4 Suggested Order of Implementation </H2>
<!--docid::SEC33::-->
<P>

This project will best be suited by breaking the command-prompt functionality
into several components, and having those components implemented as functions
within the command shell.  Here is a list of tasks to consider implementing as
separate functions:
</P>
<P>

<UL>

<LI>Given a user-specified command string, tokenize it into a sequence of
      tokens based on the parsing rules described earlier in this assignment.
      Don't forget that when pipe and redirection characters appear within a
      double-quoted string, they are ignored.
<P>

</P>
<LI>Given a sequence of command tokens, convert it into a sequence of one or
      more structs, each of which represents one of the commands to be
      executed.  (If the original input is e.g. &quot;<CODE>ls -l</CODE>&quot;, there would
      be only one command struct, but if the command were &quot;<CODE>grep foo
      input.txt | sort | uniq</CODE>&quot; then there would be three command structs.)

      The command-struct would hold details like input/output/error redirection
      (if any), the number of tokens for the command, and the array of
      command-line arguments for the command.  A sequence of commands might be
      represented as a linked list, or as an array, etc.

<LI>Handle forking off and executing an external command, including
      setting up redirection in the child process, pipes (this one
      will be challenging), and waiting for the command to complete
      in the shell process.
<P>

      <STRONG>Important Note:  As stated earlier, a process can only wait for
      its immediate children to terminate.</STRONG>  This means that if the user types
      a piped sequence of commands, each of these children must be forked by
      the shell process itself; one child may not fork off the next child.
      So while I/O redirection must be performed within the child process, the
      pipes must be created in the shell process before forking off the
      children.

<STRONG>Don't try to get the entire shell working at once.</STRONG>  Rather, get
pieces of functionality working, commit them to your repository, then add
a bit more.  And as always, <STRONG>test along the way</STRONG>, so that if things
suddenly break on you, you won't have too much code to debug.  For example:

<P>

We have not yet created automated tests for this project.  In the <Q><TT>tests</TT></Q>
directory you will find several helpful utility programs that can be used to
test your shell, as well as a &quot;testing script&quot; that will be followed when we
test your shell.  Make sure to test your work along these lines, to avoid
losing points that you don't have to lose!
</P>
<P>

The test programs provided are as follows:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>sleepycat</CODE>
<DD>This command sleeps for a specified amount of time, and then behaves like
the <CODE>cat</CODE> utility.  (See &quot;<CODE>man cat</CODE>&quot; for details on
<CODE>cat</CODE>.)  This can be used to ensure that your command shell properly
waits for commands to terminate before showing the next command prompt.  It
is especially useful in testing piped command sequences.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>cattysleep</CODE>
<DD>This command is like <CODE>sleepycat</CODE>, but it sleeps after performing its
<CODE>cat</CODE>like duties.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>outerr</CODE>
<DD>This command writes <CODE>&quot;stdout&quot;</CODE> to <CODE>stdout</CODE>, and <CODE>&quot;stderr&quot;</CODE> to
<CODE>stderr</CODE>, and then terminates.  It is useful for testing redirection of
stderr, among other things.
<P>

</DL>
<P>

You can build them by typing <CODE>make</CODE> in the <Q><TT>tests</TT></Q> directory.

<H2> 2.6 Extra Credit </H2>
<!--docid::SEC35::-->
<P>

If you want a greater challenge, here are some extra credit tasks you can
complete.  (Maximum score on the assignment is 110 points.)
</P>
<P>

<UL>

<LI>
Support multiline commands.  If the input line ends with the \textbackslash
backslash character, the shell should read a second line of text,
concatenating it onto the first line of text.  This process repeats as long
as lines end with a backslash; when the line does not end with a backslash,
it is the last line of the command.  (+1 point)
<P>

</P>
<LI>
In addition to &gt; output redirection, shells also support the &gt;&gt; sequence
to cause the process to append to an existing file instead of truncating
it.  (+1 point)
<P>

</P>
<LI>
It should be obvious that you can't redirect standard error with &gt;, since this
redirects standard output.  Many shells also allow redirection to be specified
like this:  <CODE><VAR>n</VAR>&gt;</CODE>, where <VAR>n</VAR> is an integer file descriptor.
This allows standard error to be redirected to a file by typing
<CODE>... 2&gt; errors.txt</CODE>.  (+2 points)
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Similar to the previous example, shells also often support more advanced
redirection using this mechanism:  <CODE><VAR>a</VAR>&gt;&amp;<VAR>b</VAR></CODE>, where <VAR>a</VAR>
and <VAR>b</VAR> are integer file descriptors.  This causes the shell to duplicate
file-descriptor <VAR>b</VAR> into file-descriptor <VAR>a</VAR>.  For example, the command
&quot;<CODE>someprog &gt; output.txt 2&gt;&amp;1</CODE>&quot; causes the standard output from
<CODE>someprog</CODE> to end up in <Q><TT>output.txt</TT></Q>, but the standard
output stream (file descriptor 1) is duplicated into the standard error
stream (file descriptor 2) so that any output to standard error will
end up in the same place as the standard output stream.  (+2 points)
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Use the <CODE>readline</CODE> library to allow users of your shell to scroll
through old commands using the up and down arrows, and to edit commands
in place.  If you do this, add a &quot;<CODE>history</CODE>&quot; built-in command
that lists all old commands that have been executed in order.  (+3 points)
<P>

</P>
<LI>
If you complete the previous item, number your commands in your history
output (starting with 1), and allow a user to rerun an old command by
typing <CODE>!<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>, where <VAR>n</VAR> is the number of the old
command.  (+2 points)
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Shell commands can end with an ampersand &quot;&amp;&quot; character, causing them to be
run in the background instead of the foreground.  Instead of waiting for the
child process to terminate, the parent should go on and allow the user to
type other commands.  Supporting this functionality is harder than you might
think; you will need a <CODE>SIGCHLD</CODE> signal handler to listen for when a child
process is completed.  Child process termination should be reported, but
not while the command shell is waiting for another command to complete (i.e.
while another command is running in the foreground).  (+6 points)
